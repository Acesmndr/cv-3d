# 3D CV

My three dimensional CV inspired by [Albino Tonnina's CV](https://albinotonnina.com/) and based upon the [3D CSS room model codepen by Ricardo Oliva Alonso](https://codepen.io/ricardoolivaalonso/pen/mdPzrpe).

The project is a React app which uses React Spring animation library for transitions.
